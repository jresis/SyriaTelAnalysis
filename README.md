# SyriaTel Customer Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, I seeked to provide SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, solutions regarding customer retention. Before diving into the models, the approach was an important part of what led to my conclusions. In our dataset, there were a variety of factors I observed, and one of the aims was to determine the most important variables while determining if a customer would continue using SyriaTel's services. In other words, identifying the areas where SyriaTel has the most room for improvement was a key focus. This way, I would be able to determine the factors that were most helpful and most costly to SyriaTel.
For each model, we also observed a 2x2 confusion matrix as well as four metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1).
